        <h3>Atmospheric River</h3>

        <p>
            We will be discussing a project that helps in solving a grand challenge that has been facing Egypt for a long time. The challenge is water scarcity and deficiency in water sources. <br><br>
            The solution depends on extracting water from the atmosphere (one of the cleanest sources of water). The solution depends on lowering the temperature of a stainless-steel plate than the temperature of the surrounding medium; in addition, when the air passes above the plate, it condenses forming vapor. <br><br>
            Now, onto the method of how the prototype was constructed. <br><br>
        </p>

        <h4>The process went on as follows:</h4>
        <p>
            1-	Software design: A sketch up design of the prototype was made. <br><br>
            2-	Hardware design: <br><br>
        </p>

        <p>
            Firstly, the team stacked some wooden sheets in the shape of two right-angled triangles then, they connected them with another wooden sheet to make the shape of a stand. Secondly, they made a box without its upper surface; after that, they connected one pump of the compressor to the evaporator and connected the other pump with the capillary tube, the condenser, and lastly, the thermostat. Afterward, the team turned on the prototype's motor, and the prototype started condensing water.<br><br>
        </p>

        <h4>Now to the analysis of the project:</h4>
        <p>
            After building the prototype and ensuring that it is working, and after getting the required results, the team started analyzing the obtained results. After carefully analyzing the results using important chemical laws such as TDS, and pH, they were now sure that the project was a great success; the success was because the results were as follows: TDS (Total dissolved solids) = total dissolved solids/the number of liters= 137mg/L (ppm) <br><br>

            The pH (It represents the degree of acidity or alkalinity of water) <br>
            = - log [H⁺] = 7.7 which is considered perfect for domestic use. <br><br>

            This project was a great success as it did solve the problem of water scarcity in Egypt. This happened as a result of the built prototype functioning properly by collecting the required water from the atmosphere and later on the collected water was carefully analyzed to ensure that it could be used domestically, which was confirmed by the results of the tests. <br><br>
